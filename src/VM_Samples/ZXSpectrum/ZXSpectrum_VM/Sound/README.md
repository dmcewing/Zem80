## Beeper implementation

This folder contains a **very** basic beeper implementation for the Spectrum emulation. The timing is off somewhere and so the resulting audio is choppy but recognisable. 

This was only possible through the use of the fantastic NAudio library by Mark Heath. All credit to Mark for his amazing work.
